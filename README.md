ðŸ’³ RiskLens â€“ AI-Powered Credit Risk Scoring Model

An end-to-end **machine learning pipeline** to predict the likelihood of loan default using real-world financial data. 
This project combines **traditional ML** with **explainable AI (XAI)** and **LLM-powered reasoning** to simulate real-world credit risk analysis systems.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project answers one question:  
**Can we predict if a loan applicant is likely to default and explain the reasoning behind that prediction clearly and responsibly?**

To solve this, I built a complete pipeline using:

- âœ… **Random Forest** for robust classification
- âœ… **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance
- âœ… **SHAP** to explain model decisions (global + local)
- âœ… **Manual rule-based logic** to simulate business knowledge
- âœ… **GPT-2 (Hugging Face)** to auto-generate natural language insights
